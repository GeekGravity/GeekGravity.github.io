        <p className="flex text-center px-160 py-12 text-2xl text-white ">
          Hey there! I'm Mathews Jaison and I'm a second-year Computer Science
          student at Simon Fraser University, with a strong passion for building
          innovative software solutions. I enjoy working on full-stack web
          development and data analysis. My technical expertise includes Python,
          C++, SQL, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. Beyond coding,
          I thrive on competitionâ€”whether it's playing table tennis or following
          the thrilling world of Formula 1. When I need a break from the screen,
          I pick up my guitar and unwind with music. Checkout my resume below!
